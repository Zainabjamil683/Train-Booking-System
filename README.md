#Description:
This repository contains the code for a simulated train booking system implemented in Python. The system models a train service allowing passengers to book seats for journeys from the foot to the top of a mountain and vice versa. It includes functionalities such as seat availability display, seat booking, billing calculations, and historical records of bookings and income.

#Key Features:
Displays available seats for different train timings
Enables booking seats for specific departure and return times
Calculates bills considering free ticket discounts
Tracks and displays the history of booked seats and income for each journey
Implemented using object-oriented programming principles in Python

#Usage:
Users can interact with the system through the console interface
Book seats for desired departure and return times
View historical data of bookings and income for the day

#Notes:
The code is structured within a Train class, facilitating easy management of train schedules and bookings.
The main program loop allows continuous bookings until the day ends.

#Contributions:
Contributions and improvements to the codebase are welcome. Please fork the repository, make changes, and submit pull requests for review.
